# unsupervised-machine-learning-challenge (MYOPIA CLUSTERS)

## Objectives
In this challenge, I utilised unsupervised machine learning algorithms to fit the data to a model and applied clustering algorithms to place data into groups.

## Context
You are on the data science team of a medical research company that’s interested in finding better ways to predict myopia, or nearsightedness. Your team has tried—and failed—to improve their classification model when training on the whole dataset. However, they believe that there might be distinct groups of patients that would be better to analyse separately. So, your supervisor has asked you to explore this possibility by using unsupervised learning.

## Steps Taken
* Part 1: Prepare the Data 

* Part 2: Apply Dimensionality Reduction (with PCA and t-SNE)

* Part 3: Perform a Cluster Analysis with K-means

* Part 4: Make a Recommendation (Includes visualisation of findings)

## Key Findings
The scatterplot of the t-SNE output was shown to be inconclusive on whether distinct clusters existed within the dataset.

A K-means cluster analysis was used to further examine this data through the generation of an elbow curve. The point of inflection on the elbow curve suggests that 5 clusters of myopia patients exist within the dataset.

The visualisations can be found in the 'UnSupLrn_myopia.ipynb' jupyter notebook.
